**This mod does not require Fabric API.**

Disable Hotbar Scrolling is a simple mod, which, as the name suggests, is used to disable scrolling in the hotbar.

This mod primarily targets people in the PvP community and others who wish to get familiar with their keybinds. The logic behind this mod is as follows: If you can't scroll in the hotbar, the only way you can use the different items equipped in it is to utilize your keybinds.

## Credits
 - Huge shoutout to [robotkoer](https://modrinth.com/user/robotkoer) for creating and maintaining the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, as it was the only way I could play Minecraft properly! Without this modpack, I would have never played MC Java, and as a result, never gotten into modding the game.
 - Another huge shoutout to [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/@ModdingByKaupenjoe/) for his [Java Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1FeXvEogpjz4SvHxF_FJRO6) and [Minecraft Fabric Modding Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EMYzuBUTYjHnFeBrRFbesk) playlists! They're a great resource for anyone who wants to get started with Minecraft modding.
 - I'm truly grateful to [Devin](https://modrinth.com/user/Devin) for making an extremely high-quality icon for this mod on short notice.
 - Thanks a lot to the Fabric community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FabricMC/discussions) and to [Kaupenjoe's community on Discord](https://url.kaupenjoe.net/discord) for helping me out with the various issues I had when making this mod and tolerating my stupid mistakes.
